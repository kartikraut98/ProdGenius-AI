Just a guy who reads a lot.  But I do have some thoughts on  Winter's Tale.<br />750 pages of beautifully written words, sentences, paragraphs, chapters and dialogue of....of....uhh...I’m not sure.  Helprin is certainly one of the finest wordsmiths of his generation.  And he writes an off times interesting conglomeration of vignettes and characters that are loosely tied together in interaction and occurrences.  But A story, this isn’t.  Oh, it has a main character, sort of.  The hero.  But a great deal of the narrative has absolutely nothing to do with him.  I’ve seen it written that this is a love story.  A chick book it is, but a love story it isn’t.  For it to be a love story there would have to be some continuity of that love story, with an introduction, a middle and an end and that just isn’t in the book.  But he sure does write beautifully.<br /><br />It takes place in an alternate reality of New York, in the early 1900s and late 1900s, with the hero managing to go from one time to the other (along with hundreds of bad guys), with no explanation of how or why.  There’s a great white horse that gets a lot of ink (who also made the time jump) and I’d like to say he has a lot to do with the story but there’s that problem of there being no coherent story.  Things happen inexplicably and the narrative takes tangents and then tangents within tangents, ending nowhere and adding nothing, save for themselves.  There are no supernatural events in this alternate reality...things are just different.  And then there’s the very long lead up to a big finale with a giant bridge of light to nowhere, except nothing happens and it just goes away.  What was it for?  Where was it supposed to go?  Who knows?  But he sure writes beautifully.<br /><br />There’s romance among the different characters, which I assume is the reason the book is so popular with women and of course, he writes beautifully.<br /><br />Here’s the deal:  If you’re a man or if you like your novels to have a semblance of structure and continuity, with a narrative that makes sense, then skip this book. But if you like a beautifully written book, regardless of whether or not it makes any sense.....go for it.<br /><br />But he sure writes beautifully.\"),\n",

What may be more pleasing is Helprin's writing style than the actual plot, which has religious overtones I was not expecting.  Although the novel is cast in the backdrop of New York City, the location of countless novels and stories, Winter's Tale is more about fate, death, dying, mortality, hope, and love than about the city.  What I enjoyed most was some of Helprin's writing techniques that had the stamina to last the entire novel, such as the creation of an atmosphere of constant winter.  I agree with some reviewers that the ending was a bit depressing.  For a novel that carried on for hundreds and hundreds of pages this beautiful, magical story, I hoped for a more significant ending.  It seemed the ending came abruptly, or, perhaps for a novel of 688 pages, Helprin should have started setting the stage for his ending a bit sooner to allow for it to have a bigger impact.<br /><br />The novel opens with a white horse, who takes on the symbolic meaning of a higher power.  It follows the life of Peter Lake, who was brought to the shores of the United States as an infant during the great immigration.  As such, he is raised not by his parents but by a group of early people settled in the marshes around New York City.  The magic seems to begin He takes on a life of crime as would a typical outsider to mainstream society.  Peter Lake's magical, extraordinary life begins in his first encounter with this white horse.  The next point of the novel is when Peter Lake meets and falls in love with Beverly Penn and their short relationship together.  From then on, we are introduced to other characters, who have relationships with the Penn family or within their immediate circle of contacts.  Some of these character developments arguably may be too long and if shortened could reduce the novel by some 100 - 200 unnecessary pages.  I was left wondering about Evan, Marratta, the brother of Hardesty Marratta, who featured prominently in Hardesty's introduction to the story.  All the other characters ever mentioned in the novel were accounted for and I kept thinking Hardesty was going to reconnect with his selfish, inhuman brother at some point, especially near the end of the novel when all the beauty of the city seemed to be dissipating as the time of one era gave rise to another.<br /><br />Overall, Winter's Tale was a joy to read and only began to seem tedious (in all its many pages) when the two city newspapers, The Sun and The Ghost, emerged.  It was at this point that I also felt the political and religious views of Helprin coming through.  Such views are embedded in the entire length of the novel, but become clearer and more assertive toward the end of the story.  I read an interview with Helprin where he said that his novel contained no elements of magical realism, but I noted great similarities between Helprin's metaphors and those of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, a classic writer of the magical realism genre.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about Winter's Tale was the ability to lose myself in a mammoth, magical story that spans hundreds of years and is told by an author, who clearly has a gift for using the most extraordinary and beautiful language.  What I liked least was the ending which wrapped up all the loose ends too quickly and lacked the depth that was present in the beginning and sustained throughout the middle of the novel, as well as the political and religious overtones that seemed to grow in weight towards the novel's end.  Despite these minor drawbacks, Winter's Take is a great work of art and I am eager to read another of Helprin's novels and only hope it will match, if not exceed, Helprin's beautiful writing style and talent for creating a most enthralling atmosphere with only words.\"),\n",

That review and others referenced Winter\\'s Tale with high regard, and, after learing that the film version of the story is currently in production and is starring some great actors, my curiosity was peaked and I decided to give the novel a try.<br /><br />Winter\\'s Tale was thoroughly enjoyable, even a page-turner during some scenes.  It has a rich, dream-like quality, and there are points in the novel where I was totally immersed in the setting, the characters, the plot, as if seeing it unfold in a dream.  I attribute this to the quality of Helprin\\'s writing and the fantasy elements of the story. I also enjoyed the humor that runs through the story.  During one particularly hilarious interlude I found myself laughing out loud.  Also, the main character Peter Lake and the white horse Athansor are interesting and memorable characters.  I wish the novel included more page-time with these two, but I suspect that the focus of the upcoming movie will be centered on Peter Lake and his adventures and struggles.  The novel does feature a wide cast of characters and settings.  It does not fit into any mold or formula, or even follow typical storyline arcs.<br /><br />When you read reviews of \"Winter\\'s Tale\" you will find many with the comment \"it was too long\", or \"they could have edited out half the book\", or \"too many descriptions and not enough action\", and the like.  I understand these comments, but if Winter\\'s Tale were edited in this fashion, it would be a very different novel.  It is meant to be immersive.  The plot lines do sometimes move fast, but usually slowly.  The romanticized view of New York City, and winter is rewarding to the reader that jumps in and lets the story unfold with its maney characters, places, and ...times.  It draws you upward with its rich visions and characters.<br /><br />Is Winter\\'s Tale a masterpiece and a new American classic of the last 30 years?  I\\'m not qualified to answer that, but I enjoyed the story, would recommend it to others, and am looking forward to the movie!'),\n",

The closest thing I can compare it to is [[ASIN:0061120057 Little, Big]] by John Crowley, in that both novels are quasi-fairytales, seeped in magical realism (or romanticism?), with an emphasis on setting over character, and told in achingly beautiful poetic-prose - the kind that makes you sporadically pause in order to savour what you\\'ve just read.<br /><br />And like \"Little, Big\" it\\'s pretty inscrutable. Ask anyone who has read either book what they\\'re about and I guarantee their first word will be a drawn out: \"errrr....\"<br /><br />So as a definition, let\\'s go with contemporary fantasy set in New York City between (roughly) the year 1895 to 2000 (which was still a few decades away when the book was first published in 1983). The main character (again, roughly) is Peter Lake, whose parents were immigrants denied admission at Ellis Island and so forced to cast him adrift in a small model ship known called City of Justice. Found and raised by the Baymen of Bayonne Marsh, he\\'s sent to Manhattan once he\\'s reached adulthood to seek out his fortune there.<br /><br />But this is not New York as we know it. This is New York as seen through a prism of light, where all its buildings, seasons, people, customs and streets are described in intricate detail, a city in which a mysterious \"cloud wall\" lingers at the edges of human habitation, where two daily newspapers war with each other for supremacy over their readerships, and where a beautiful white horse occasionally comes to the aid of those in desperate need.<br /><br />It\\'s here that Peter is trained as a mechanic, though he also runs afoul of Pearly Soames and the Short Tails Gang, who rope him into their circle of thieves. Soon enough he\\'s just as accomplished in pick-pocketing as he is at fixing machines, but it\\'s after breaking into the house of upscale newspaper manager Isaac Penn that Peter falls in love for the first time.<br /><br />Beverly Penn is an ethereal beauty dying of consumption, which requires her to sleep in a tent erected on the rooftop of the house where she can simultaneously maintain a cool temperature and silently communicate with the stars. Before you roll your eyes, it\\'s important to recall the dream-like tone of the book, one which forgoes realism in order to present a series of images and emotions and thought-provoking insights.<br /><br />But (despite what the trailers [[ASIN:B00L8O35JU for the film adaptation]] would have you believe) Peter and Beverly\\'s love story is hardly the focus of the novel. In fact, it probably only takes up one-tenth of the story as a whole. There are plenty of other characters, such as Hardesty Marratta, a Californian whose father\\'s will forces him to choose between a vast inheritance and a family heirloom, or Virginia Gamely, a young newspaper writer who comes from the ice-encased Lake of the Coheeries to transcribe the beauty of New York onto the page.<br /><br />But if you were to ask me what actually *happened* in this book... well, that\\'s where I got a bit lost. Plenty of characters journey to New York and fall in love there. Pearly Soames continues to obsessively hunt down Peter Lake. There are some vague stirrings of an apocalyptic event on the horizon, one which may sweep the city into a Golden Age or destroy it entirely. Maybe?<br /><br />As much as I struggled with the bizarre plotting, it\\'s Helprin\\'s mastery of poetic-prose that kept me turning pages, yet just as often it forced me to stop reading and write down certain sentences and passages, just so I could return to them later. Whether he\\'s describing a scene...<br /><br />\"The snow did not melt, as it usually would have so early in the fall, but stayed fearlessly in place while a paralyzing dream of absolute zero floated down from Canada and made the winter sky into a brittle blue arch.\"<br /><br />Or a character...<br /><br />\"He was full of laughter that gurgled from his nose and throat like water going down a stuffed drain.\"<br /><br />Or an observation...<br /><br />\"Lonely people have enthusiasms which cannot always be explained. When something strikes them as funny, the intensity and length of their laughter mirrors the depth of their loneliness, and they are capable of laughing like hyenas. When something touches their emotions, it runs through them like Paul Revere, awakening feelings that gather into great armies.\"<br /><br />... nearly everything he writes is told so beautifully that even when you don\\'t know exactly what\\'s happening, you can\\'t help but love the *way* it\\'s happening.<br /><br />Before writing this review, I had a look around the internet to see what other people had to say about it. The verdicts seemed to verge between rhapsodic praise and bewildered disgust, with no middle ground between the two. That\\'s pretty much the response I expected. For me personally, I\\'ll admit that there is one major difference between John Crowley\\'s \"Little, Big\" and Mark Helprin\\'s \"Winter\\'s Tale\" - though I was equally bewildered by a lot of what happened in Crowley\\'s book, I know that once day I\\'ll revisit it and enjoying reading it with fresh eyes. In Helprin\\'s case, I feel that once was probably enough.'),\n",

I thought I could handle it--I'm a sucker for lush prose and vivid images and fantasy, came in braced for a prose poem that would take some hard work to unravel and appreciate.  About halfway through I was begging to leave, and ended the book in jumps of twenty pages or more.<br /><br />The images are amazing.  No doubt about it.  There are moments of high, high fantasy in this book, from pretty much anything Athansor does to the tea-bag colloquy of the Short Tails to the various iterations of the salver.  Tubercular Beverly under the stars, and what she says the stars are.  Virginia scaling her way out of the town.<br /><br />Thing is, the language wasn't all that.  Some really good lines here and there, and accurate in creating the trippy romantic mood.  But I was more often surprised at my lack of surprise at the metaphors, shading onto the trite.<br /><br />And the characters.  First, the relationship between Peter Lake and Beverly seems a little creepy--I know the mores were different back then (and it's an alternative universe anyhow), and a twenty-year-plus difference in age between romantic partners was not as unusual, nor the woman being underage.  But Peter Lake got too lucky to have this be taken seriously as a great love story.  Not quite a May-December romance, but a March-late September.  No wonder it rocked him, redeemed him--all that's believable from his perspective, but still ethically murky, suspicious.  I want to root for him but can't quite.  Second, the cast of characters changes almost entirely a third of the way through the book.  A daring move for Helprin, breathtaking, admirable in its daring, but when you do that you'd better have some amazing characters to pick up the baton, and an village matron with an unexpectedly recondite Latinate vocabulary doesn't quite work.  I gave the new characters one hundred pp. or so and was ready to quit, never having entirely bought into the first batch anyhow, although the place was gorgeous, and did I mention the images?  Perhaps the ending justifies everything, and I didn't read enough of the last few hundred pages or so to appreciate the complexity of its payoff, but Winter's Tale is a long book, and needs to make a certain amount of promises early to justify its length and inspire perseverance.<br /><br />Perhaps that's it.  I couldn't figure out what kind of book this was, what kind of expectations to place on it, until it was too late.<br /><br />I would read bits of this book again, if I knew where to find them, but I wouldn't read it again, nor would I recommend it.\"),\n",

Since that first night, over two weeks ago, I\\'ve lived in an enchanted world of  music, white horses, drifting cloud banks that transcend time, shimmering frozen lakes and human love and sorrow aswirl like drifting flakes of narrative snow as each February evening fell.  I tried to pick it up during the day but simply couldn\\'t do it.  Some odd superstition of mine felt that reading the book during the day might break the spell the book cast each night.<br /><br />And the book truly does cast a spell.  Helprin is a stylist of the first water and, especially whilst engrossed in the first half of the book I was completely transported by the magic of....Winter.  For, make no mistake, Winter - not New York, not Peter Lake and his love for Beverly Penn, not time nor justice - is the primary trope of the book.  And how lovely and enchanting it has been for me these past two weeks of Winter nights to fall into an unreality somehow more real than the quotidian.<br /><br />Having given the book and its author the high laud which is its due, I must demur that it is not an unmitigated triumph.  The book takes its title from an author and play I shouldn\\'t have to mention to anyone acquainted with great literature.  And, throughout the book, one finds oneself stumbling across lines directly taken from Joyce, Yeats, Goethe, Wordsworth, Whitman and on and on until seemingly every great writer under the sun has a line or two or three expropriated by Helprin.  It is very curious, and I\\'m not quite sure how to take it.  But it does seem to me that Helprin is simply showboating more than a bit herein.  But it\\'s not the serious flaw in the book.<br /><br />The serious flaw in the book is the tendentious, crackerjack philosophy Helprin bangs on about concerning time and justice throughout the work.  It would have been the greater part of valour to have left this to the purely visionary William Blake - Another author appropriated: \"the marriage of heaven and hell\" makes its way into a sentence - realm in which it shines.  Unfortunately,  most pointedly in the short chapter entitled \"Nothing is Random\", he makes his metaphysical, Panglossian  case in what is very poor logic indeed:<br /><br />\"If nothing is random, and everything is predetermined, how can there be free will?  The answer to that is simple. Nothing is predetermined; it is determined, or was determined, or will be determined.\"<br /><br />What tosh!  What Helprin is trying to validate here is his laissez-faire approach to the human condition.  He thinks that if nothing is predetermined and that if moments flow backwards and forwards through time, or if there is no \"real\" time, it makes them non-deterministic. He has merely suggested a way out of predeterminism, or predestination, but not the root of the problem, determinism itself.  It merely becomes post-determinism or whatever depending upon which way time and causality are flowing, or, if time is unreal and the universe static, bound in timeless concatenations. This is one of the infantile diseases of philosophy, and leads one to cringe at the thought, as another reviewer has suggested, that Helprin has read too much Ayn Rand.  One word of hers is too much!<br /><br />But, I urge the intrepid reader to ignore these pseudo-philosophical ramblings, and let the enchantment of the imagery and startling writing enrapture her or him:<br /><br />\"Winter, then, in its early and clear stages, was a purifying engine that ran unhindered over city and country, alerting the stars to sparkle violently and shower their silver light into the arms of bare upreaching trees:  It was a mad and beautiful thing that scoured raw the souls of animals and man, driving them before it until they loved to run.  And what it did to northern forests can hardly be described, considering that it iced the branches of the sycamores on Chrystie Street and swept them back and forth until they rang like ranks of bells.\"<br /><br />Not a perfect book, but, O, it rings like ranks of bells!'),\n",

It is a tale that stretches the boundaries of time and imagination, of dreams and reality, where nothing is quite what it seems, but what it has the POTENTIAL to be, and the fundamental element that drives all of this is the power and influence of LIGHT.  It is this power that fascinates and enslaves the evil protagonist, Pearly Soames, in his quest to obtain and possess the power of COLOR, which of course is a PRODUCT of light, and it is what fascinates and drives the Architect and master bridge-builder Jackson Meade to attempt perfection in his bridge-building, in order to  create, by the hand of man, a bridge so perfect that it is in effect, a rainbow that will attract and return God's justice to the earth once more.

As I did, I realized that this is a steampunk fantasy. Remember, this was published in 1983, when there were no PC's, no cell phones, no Internet for the masses. No one knew what steampunk was then, either.  Some authors have looked forward to some of  the potentially positive social effects of new technology in their near futures, like Neal Stephenson did in his novel The Diamond Age, written about the same time. Others, like Mark Helprin in this novel, have thought about it and decided that their vison of the future is not so bright, so they look forward, and then back, and then forward, and then back, until readers suffer vertigo. This novel is supposed to be confusing and a bit unpleasant to try to sort out. That's the point. The future is going to be a scary and confusing mess, but time and humanity will go on.  The steampunk assumption is that in a post-apocolyptic setting we would go back to steam power to run elaborate, complex, and heroic machines, as did our Victorian ancestors,  and there are plenty of these machines in this novel: the printing presses, airships, and gigantic boats, for example. I didn't notice any time machines, but with all the spinning around from Victorian to present day, there ought to be one. Some reviewers have asserted that this novel is great literature, but those who do probably have read very little. It is literary, however, and that makes it interesting to read. Much of the celebrated prose is more purple than poetic, but compared to the average best seller, reading the frequent flashy phrases is fun. This novel does seem self-indulgent on the author's part. He shows off; he plays; he spins in a circle until he falls down dizzy, but so do his readers.

The strident tone of the moralizing and method of idealization which Helprin uses in elaborating his somewhat murky ethical predilections smacks of Rand's horrid little tomes, and many of his characters (especially Praeger de Pinto) end up resembling the very worst of Rand's libertarian atrocity exhibitions (albeit with much more flare).  He places his ideal characters in ideal situations so that a few poorly developed ethical conceits can be displayed, nestled amongst the many baubles of prose.<br /><br />More over, this method of idealization coupled with some fairly shoddy character development renders his characters not only more or less invulnerable, but also indistinguishable (the majority of the personalities in the novel use much the same voice and act in much the same manner).  None of the characters in the novel ever appear to be truly challenged, and this lack of tension or suspense leads to a fairly uninteresting narrative, despite all of the (ostensibly exciting) magical occurrences.<br /><br />Of course, Helprin is a word smith at the very height of his powers.  There's no doubt that some of the sentences in this book literally sing as they are read;  unfortunately, much of the time the prose becomes a bit too self-involved and renders itself turgid and gaudy.  Still, there is much beauty to be found in the structure and syntax of the thing.\"),\n",

To say this complex portrayal of a mythological New York City--along with a mythological Upstate New York--is ambitious is an understatement; Helprin gives us a vortex of competing and contrasting plots and themes that ultimately, unfortunately, cancel each other out.  But can Helprin write?  Yes!  His amazing descriptions of the city, its citizens, the architecture, the mechanics, the actions of a metaphysical white horse, the menacing Pearly Soames and his gang of Short Tails, and the timeless and transcendent love of Peter Lake are prose to savor over and over.  Yet again, the story cannot wrap itself around such magnificent writing, as the contrasting plot lines continue to get tangled en route to what is a hopeless mess of an ending.<br /><br />As I finished the last page, I found myself wondering:  What is this book about?  Peter Lake's determination to become immortal to timelessly love the beautiful, yet consumptive, Beverly Penn?  A city doomed--yet destined to become just?  Building the ultimate metaphysical bridge to span all ages?  The season of winter as a fundamental human transformation?  I realized I had no answer to what WINTER'S TALE is about, and that's the problem with this very long book.  There are far too many themes, plots, subplots, and the waltzing in and out of far too many characters, to create rhythm, pace, and story.  And by the end of this novel, the multi-layered components just get in each others' way; there's death, there's rebirth, there's destruction, there's metaphysical reclamation--there's the reader's desperate desire to just get to the last page.  Masterfully written while needlessly complicated and complex, Mark Helprin's WINTER'S TALE is a 750-page mixed message.<br />~D. Mikels, Esq.\"),\n",

So I picked up Winter\\'s Tale from the bookstore shelf. I really enjoyed this long, winding, impossibly possible story. Several reviewers have commented on its very descriptive style (\"too many adjectives\") and I\\'d have given it 5 stars instead of 4 if it was only slightly more compact. On the other hand, as much as I occasionally felt, \"yeah, yeah, get on with it\" I also felt, \"Well, it\\'s his story. He can tell it the way he wants to. I don\\'t have to read it.\" But I kept reading it because I liked the characters, because I wondered where the heck he was going with this and because I\\'ve never been iceboating but always wanted to. I finally decided the language is \"painterly\" because you definitely see it happening even if taking the phrases apart as literal ideas doesn\\'t work. I don\\'t understand the reviews that say there\\'s no plot: the potentially complete alteration of the current world is not a plot?!?! I couldn\\'t help but think about the ways this book prefigured 911 and stories from the months following the WTC attack. Yeah, it bugged me that each of the main female characters is incredibly beautiful (that\\'s how you know they must be good), the men are typically strong silent types, and there\\'s just a little too much nostalgia for the horse-drawn, steam-powered world as if the days before penicillin were always cheery and joyful for all. And it might help if you\\'ve spent at least a little time living in New York City. But in the end (without spoiling anything), I\\'m left enjoying the enormous pondering of time, love, purpose, beauty and magic.

Looking at the cast list and noticing that fully half the main characters aren\\'t listed it looks like they\\'re going to just settle for part of the story. So read the book first!

Don't have a preconceived notion of what you want from it. It is not a linear story about a particular set of characters. Characters and storylines disappear abruptly and sometimes permanently. Don't expect immensely satisfying conclusions. It is more about the journey than the destination. Lastly I would suggest that you read this book slowly. I almost always finish even long books in under 2 weeks but this one should be savored and read in small doses. 2 or 3 months is not a long time for this novel.

His writing reminds me of only two other writers,  Chesterton, with his lighthearted raving, and periodically of Dylan Thomas, with his drunken, obscene grandeur.  Those are the only two.  It is, for its time period and in its subject matter, quite unique.  In plot structure, Winter's Tale could possibly be classed with works of modern magic realism like the novels of Salmon Rushdie and Haruki Murakami, but in tone it is much more lighthearted, rooted not in absurdist nihilism but soaring with hope for human life in all of its infinite, varied patterns.  Chesterton wrote, &#34;Angels fly because they take themselves lightly,&#34; and Helprin seems to have taken that bit of wisdom to heart, often poking fun at language itself (at one point he describes mountains as being &#34;mountainy&#34;).  At times this book reads like the long-winded tall tale of a southern grandfather, at times like the diary of a confused but transcendent saint, and at times it has the vivid, disjointed imagery of an opium-addict's visions.  Bits of plot are fairytale-esque with a capitalist twist: a burglar falls for a rich newspaper-man's daughter, and a milk-cart horse displays unsuspected magical powers.  Other sections have the flashy theatrics, sweeping scope, and nostalgic backdrops of a musical (Moulin Rouge comes to mind).  It essentially features a sort of fantastic clone of New York City at the beginning and end of the nineteen hundreds, and it overflows with affection for even the most horrible aspects of that metropolis, muse of so many great authors.  I could go on to discuss the many characters and caricatures, but  it is the experience of reading this book that will drive you away or draw you in.  It is like watching a master juggler at work.  At the beginning, he is juggling something simple like balls or handkerchiefs, but he quickly and imperceptibly switches them out for bananas, perhaps plucking one out to answer the phone on it while manipulating the rest one-handed.  Then, he is juggling snow globes, each a tiny world and falling within its rising arc.  Then glittering knives, flaring torches, a human infant, making figure eights to the ceiling.  When he switches back to bananas for three hours, you are frustrated that he is making you watch him play when he is capable of real art.  You might stay in your seat, hoping for another glimpse of a world without gravity, or you might leave and go back to more mundane pursuits.  There are jewels in this book, real wisdom like that quoted above, but they are all mixed up in a magpie's hoard with other words that glitter but have no real substance.  The novel speaks often of a great pattern inherent in the world and of ultimate justice for those who suffer, if one's perspective can just be panoramic enough to encompass it.  Unfortunately, the world of the novel does not successfully back this idea.  Days after turning the final page, I still see no purpose or even causal relation in most of the events that occur within. It is mostly pure, disorganized performance, drawing attention away from the actual communication that is the work of literature.<br /><br />If you like books to be rational, trustworthy, and feature complex characters whose conflicts and salvations stem organically from their own strengths and flaws, and if the idea of closing a book feeling as if you have listened to an eloquent drunk proclaim and digress for hours does not appeal to you, I would stay away from Winter's Tale.  If, however, you will read solely for the music of language, and if you have a deep-running love for New York and/or a high threshold for silliness and mysticism (always interesting bedfellows), you might want to check this one out.  Save it for when you're snowed in, though.  This is a book that needs to be read in a blizzard.\"),\n",

I own and have read all of his books, but Winters Tale is my favorite. It and Les Miserables I have read at least three times each. They are underlined and margin noted extensively. They have challenged me in how I look at the work, how I think about love, and how my actions affect others or how they should. What is sacrifice? What is life. What can we do for the human condition. What is Evil and what is Good&#34; What do we do about gray areas? How do we interact with the bureaucracy of a government we need to manage our country? What if we are part of that bureaucracy.  A civil servant. A county employee. City employee. While maintaining an interesting plot,  Mark Helprin gets us thinking. His young adult trilogy with Veil of Snows makes a great read aloud for seventh graders. 5-10 minutes a day. Students were excited and some wrote letters to him...which were answered. If you love big cities, Winters Tale gives poetic pause to the beating heart of The Big Apple and those whose hopes and dreams are tied up in its bustling life.'),\n",

There are lots of fantastical elements in this novel but for the most part they are subtle. The writing and imagery is wonderful. As I was reading the fantasy elements or just things that made it clear that this was not the normal New York City. However it kind of lost me with about a quarter of the book left to go.

A gentleman by the name of Benjamin De Mott wrote a review on the book in the year  of 1983 when it first came out.

The first half more or less manages to capture, in a literally magical way, the spirit of 1900-ish New York City: its brutal poverty and desperate immigrant circumstances, the transient heroism and optimism of early industrialism epitomized by bridge-building, the rather amusing way New York Cityites romanticize upstate NY as some kind of Ice Playland for their amusement . . . the second half is written as if the events of the next 80 or so years never happened (no depression, no war, no resurgence in the 50s-60s, no Robert Moses city destruction and racism, no Cultural Revolution, etc. etc. . . )  In other words, like the fantasy of a Republican who thinks it all went wrong after FDR and wants to pretend the capitalist excesses of the early century didn't lead to the Depression and FDR.

The prose is beautiful, the descriptions of New York (the city and upstate) during the winter are enchanting, and the problems that it deals with--love, the ebbing of time, and justice--are universal.<br /><br />This book is 750 pages long. By the time I got to page 200 I was completely enthralled, and knew that I would probably re-read the whole thing within a year or so. I can't recall the last time I felt that way about a book even half as long.<br /><br />Why do I and so many other people love this book? Probably because it deals with some very fundamental human problems: our inability to move through time to see loved ones, love, and justice--and actually shows someone who is able to transcend those boundaries in the form of Peter Lake. He is a superhero who is about as normal as a superhero can be. Perhaps the best way to introduce both the themes of the book and the prose are through the following quote:<br /><br />&#34;they [dancers at a new year's party] coasted into the new year and felt its strength commencing...they cried because of the magic and the contradictions; because time had passed and time was left; because they saw themselves as if they were in a photograph that had winked fast enough to contradict their mortality; because the city around them had conspired to break a hundred thousand hearts; and because they and everyone else had to float upon this sea of troubles, watertight. Sometimes there were islands, and when they found them they held fast, but never could they hold fast enough not to be moved and once again overwhelmed.&#34;<br /><br />Here we see people laughing, living, fighting against time (and the inevitable death and decay that it brings), and trying to live as best they can in the here and now. They dancers live, have fun, and try to grab whatever enjoyment and love that they can before it all slips through their hands. This, I think, is the main problem that the book explores--the ebbing of time and the imperative of finding these &#34;islands of beauty&#34; and transcendent meaning in our day to day lives. Peter Lake is such a compelling character because he is able to overcome these boundaries.<br /><br />The book is not quite a fantasy, though it is certainly fantastical. And despite that, or because of it, the truths that Helprin gives us are closer to reality than what can be revealed in a more &#34;realistic&#34; format.<br /><br />&#34;Justice&#34; comes up a lot here, and it took me a little while to see what Helprin was getting at. What I think he's saying is this: nothing is for naught because all we do is part of a higher purpose, and our actions live to reverberate throughout history long after we're gone. Justice is difficult to rationalize because we can't know the exact consequences of what we do. &#34;Injustice&#34; is defined as not being able to see into the future, escape the limits of time, and go through time, to see how exactly our actions matter. There's quite a bit more to chew on here, I'm sure that we can make some comparisons to Plato's Republic, given how often Helprin talks about the &#34;perfectly just city.&#34;<br /><br />The book is deeply, profoundly conservative on a philosophical level. Thankfully, however, it takes its conservatism from Oakeshott (there's a wonderful passage about the difficulty of rationalizing justice) and Burke rather than from the mainstream Republican Party. I'm quite surprised that there hasn't been more commentary on this from intellectual conservative circles--or academic circles for that matter, as a Google scholar search reveals very little. There's even been an entire book on Whit Stillman's movies, so I'm not sure why we haven't seen something from the New Criterion about this.<br /><br />All in all, a beautiful book. Do read it. If the length is intimidating, the first 200 pages are relatively self contained and can be read first before deciding to go forward.\"),\n",

In short, Helprin extols the pre-Progressive Era as a glorious, if messy, alternative to the \"immoral\" effects of welfare state liberalism.<br /><br />Regressively repackaging the fabulist techniques of South America\\'s magical realists, Helprin creates for our edification a small band of geniuses who fight for the right to express their personal excellence (through neo-liberal capitalism) against the leveling tide of utopian utilitarianism (aka Marxism/60s Liberalism).  All his characters are exalted individuals, even the villain, and so all become very quickly tiresome.  Because they are geniuses, they don\\'t learn anything as the story progresses.  Instead we learn that genius must be given every opportunity to express itself, as long as it is for the benefit of mankind.  As such, WINTER\\'S TALE violates the core idea of what a novel is.<br /><br />Real novels tend to be suspicious of the exalted, especially of those who occupy exalted positions based on birth or social class.  Helprin, while not a supporter of an aristocracy based on birth, does believe in a perverted version of the Jeffersonian idea of a natural aristocracy.  Perverted because it fails to take into account the barriers erected by elites to the expression of this American idea of a wise and benevolent meritocracy.  It therefore suits his neo-liberal ideological bent to set the larger part of his story at a time in American history where there was more class fluidity, a time before the large corporate enterprises and their hierarchical management structures began to foreclose the possibility of true individualism.<br /><br />And so he hypocritically points to this pre-corporatist time as a valid model for our hyper-corporate era without having to take into consideration today\\'s anti-individualist ethos.  Writers like Swift, Defoe, Dickens, Melville, Hugo and Zola exposed the hypocrisy of the new economic elite who supplanted the old aristocracy by turning a burning interrogatory spotlight on the cruel iniquities generated by the bourgeoisie and their partners in government.  Helprin shines a soft-focus light on the savage iniquities of the Industrial Revolution and decides, all in all, it was a better time.<br /><br />WINTER\\'S TALE suffers from an underlying ideological framework that treats characters as hostages to an argument for the rightness and naturalness of neo-liberal paternalism.  Unlike a real novel, WINTER\\'S TALE papers over the cracks in our belief in the resurrected values of Calvinist capitalism, tightens the ideological blinders that support such a view, and keeps true believer\\'s prejudices firmly, and for many, blessedly, intact.'),\n",

However, because it started from the viewpoint of a horse, and was a slow start, I couldn't get into it.  Realizing recently that there was now a movie based on the book I thought I'd give it another try before seeing the movie.<br /><br />I like books that are lyrical and well-written and contain magical realism, fantasy, mystery, and some love interest.  I especially love time travel.  I found that this book had all of those elements (although the time travel aspect was not a major part of the book).<br /><br />At the core of this book was a very interesting story about mostly interesting characters, and it read like a series of fairly tales - all of which I found absorbing.  After I got through the horse's viewpoint (which was easier to read at home than on vacation), I found myself quite caught up in the story of Peter Lake and his life, and his involvement with the daughter of a rich and powerful publishing magnate.  The problem was that after the love of Peter Lake's life dies, the story diverges too much and the central thread is lost.  The author gets too caught up in the introduction of other characters and there are way too many descriptions (to the minutest detail) about winter, and snow and ice, and about a New York City that I could not relate to despite having visited there.  There was also too much about light, and time, and the promise of justice in a  &#34;just city&#34; that I found hard to relate to and never really understood.  Although the story eventually gets back to Peter Lake, I would not say that the central tenet of the book is the romance between him and his young lover, and his determination to beat time to be reunited with her.  Or, if indeed that was supposed to be the central tenet, I found that it was not achieved.<br /><br />Had I not been reading the Kobo edition (I find I can never get the true measure of the length of a book in electronic form), I might have given up on this very long book.  As it was, I read it to the end, and found that I was left disappointed.  Although I did not mind that there were lots of different characters, in the end I expected the book to come togetherThere was no sense of satisfaction of having read a good tale with a central focus to it.\"),\n",

He is an extremely gifted writer and has a tremendous talent for putting a reader \"in the scene\" and making them smell the smells and feel the feelings that they would experience if actually present.  If he writes about a cold day - you may shiver.<br /><br />I think, however, what I appreciate most are the poetic observations about life and love evident in every day occurances that are intertwined throughout his books.  He expresses the kinds of insights about life that you wish you could share with your best friend sitting under the stars at night.  I typically highlight passages or pause occasionally to reflect on his observations while reading his books.  As testimony to his style, and the way he captures feelings, one of my female friends once commented that it was hard for her to believe that this book was written by a man.<br /><br />Until more recently, most of the reviews for this book were glowing.  What I have noted from these most recent reviews, however, is that a number of readers are attracted to the book based on the upcomming movie.  Before you buy this book, you should know that generally his books have been located in the literature sections of the book stores.  So, if you buy Winter\\'s Tale with the expectation that it is going to read like popular fiction - you probably will be dissappointed (which I believe is the source of many of the low ratings).

Of all the books I recommend, nothing receives raves like Winter's Tale, a piece of magical realism from 1983 that never gets old, and can be re-read like an old friend.

Mark Helprin's prose is packed full of magic, love, loss, heartache, mortality and, perhaps most importantly, life.

There are many instances of love at first sight and Peter Lake and Anthansor's is just the first example. Later, Peter Lake meets Beverly Penn while he is attempting to burglarize her family's home and he is again, in love at first sight.  Both of these loves go on longer than a single lifetime and that is at least partly due to Peter Lake living longer than a single lifetime.<br />Helprin's greatest romance is the one he has with New York City. The City itself is the novels greatest protagonist, weathering numerous obstacles and changing into a city almost unrecognizable to the one we first see from the Bayonne Harbor. Even its biggest fan, Peter Lake, doesn't recognize is after several decades.  We can only imagine what is next for the great city after the fires die down and the city starts to rebuild.<br />There are so many wonderful examples of love, desire and hope in this novel it would be impossible to touch on all of them in these few paragraphs (perhaps why many of these reviews are a little lengthy).

Rather than give detailed points, this review notes one glaring problem with the novel that ultimately prevents it from achieving greatness.<br /><br />A great novel is an artful balance of plot, characterization, description, and pacing. Get any one of those four wrong, and the whole enterprise is threatened.<br /><br />Author Helprin tests the limits of reader patience by giving us a novel of relentless descriptions that threaten to trample everything else in _Winter's Tale_. Some would call his excessive reliance on carefully managed description told in a flowery, dream-like prose to be the essence of the book's magic. But magic can't come at the expense of all the other elements of the book, especially pacing. Not only do the descriptions of events, settings, and people in the novel go on for pages, but it's as if the author feels he must hit a descriptive grand slam with every sentence.<br /><br />The effect of all this detail is the equivalent of being buried under ten tons of potpourri, glitter, rose petals, and lace. In short, it's not so much intoxicating as suffocating.<br /><br />So the author can write a beautiful sentence and fill it will vivid imagery. Excellent. But sometimes a sentence works best when it's utilitarian, just enough words to move us forward. Yet author Helprin never met a metaphor he couldn't squeeze until exsanguinated. The effect is to enleaden _Winter's Tale_ and drive its lofty aspirations into the ground. For a story built on hoarfrost and fairy wings, the damage can't be undone.<br /><br />A little authorial restraint could have made this novel a classic. Instead, it's a laborious read encumbered by mind-numbing excess.\"),\n",

The vision and scope of the story is such that to describe one or two elements is to short-shift all the others. Instead, let me tell you what is in it. It is dramatic. It is romantic. It will lift your heart, and it will break it. It will have you dancing through scenes one moment, and standing stock still in awe over a single paragraph a moment later.

      " \"A WHITE HORSE ESCAPESTHERE WAS a white horse, on a quiet winter morning when snow covered the streets gently and was not deep, and the sky was swept with vibrant stars, except in the east, where dawn was beginning in a light blue flood. The air was motionless, but would soon start to move as the sun came up and winds from Canada came charging down the Hudson. The horse had escaped from his master's small clapboard stable in Brooklyn. He trotted alone over the carriage road of the Williamsburg Bridge, before the light, while the toll keeper was sleeping by his stove and many stars were still blazing above the city. Fresh snow on the bridge muffled his hoofbeats, and he sometimes turned his head and looked behind him to see if he was being followed. He was warm from his own effort and he breathed steadily, having loped four or five miles through the dead of Brooklyn past silent churches and shuttered stores. Far to the south, in the black, ice-choked waters of the Narrows, a sparkling light marked the ferry on its way to Manhattan, where only market men were up, waiting for the fishing boats to glide down through Hell Gate and the night. The horse was crazy, but, still, he was able to worry about what he had done. He knew that shortly his master and mistress would arise and light the fire. Utterly humiliated, the cat would be tossed out the kitchen door, to fly backward into a snow-covered sawdust pile. The scent of blueberries and hot batter would mix with the sweet smell of a pine fire, and not too long afterward his master would stride across the yard to the stable to feed him and hitch him up to the milk wagon. But he would not be there. This was a good joke, this defiance which made his heart beat in terror, for he was sure his master would soon be after him. Though he realized that he might be subject to a painful beating, he sensed that the master was amused, pleased, and touched by rebellion as often as not-if it were in the proper form and done well, courageously. A shapeless, coarse revolt (such as kicking down the stable door) would occasion the whip. But not even then would the master always use it, because he prized a spirited animal, and he knew of and was grateful for the mysterious intelligence of this white horse, an intelligence that even he could not ignore except at his peril and to his sadness. Besides, he loved the horse and did not really mind the chase through Manhattan (where the horse always went), since it afforded him the chance to enlist old friends in the search, and the opportunity of visiting a great number of saloons where he would inquire, over a beer or two, if anyone had seen his enormous and beautiful white stallion rambling about in the nude, without bit, bridle, or blanket. The horse could not do without Manhattan. It drew him like a magnet, like a vacuum, like oats, or a mare, or an open, never-ending, tree-lined toad. He came off the bridge ramp and stopped short. A thousand streets lay before him, silent but for the sound of the gemlike wind. Driven with snow, white, and empty, they were a maze for his delight as the newly arisen wind whistled across still untouched drifts and rills. He passed empty theaters, countinghouses, and forested wharves where the snow-lined spars looked like long black groves of pine. He passed dark factories and deserted parks, and rows of little houses where wood just fired filled the air with sweet reassurance. He passed the frightening common cellars full of ragpickers and men without limbs. The door of a market bar was flung open momentarily for a torrent of boiling water that splashed all over the street in a cloud of steam. He passed (and shied from) dead men lying in the round ragged coffins of their own frozen bodies. Sleds and wagons began to radiate from the markets, alive with the pull of their stocky dray horses, racing up the main streets, ringing bells. But he kept away from the markets, because there it was noontime even at dawn, and he followed the silent tributaries of the main streets, passing the exposed steelwork of buildings in the intermission of feverish construction. And he was seldom out of sight of the new bridges, which had married beautiful womanly Brooklyn to her rich uncle, Manhattan; had put the city's hand out to the country; and were the end of the past because they spanned not only distance and deep water but dreams and time. The tail of the white horse swished back and forth as he trotted briskly down empty avenues and boulevards. He moved like a dancer, which is not surprising: a horse is a beautiful animal, but it is perhaps most remarkable because it moves as if it always hears music. With a certainty that perplexed him, the white horse moved south toward the Battery, which was visible down a long narrow street as a whitened field that was crossed by the long shadows of tall trees. By the Battery itself, the harbor took color with the new light, rocking in layers of green, silver, and blue. At the end of this polar rainbow, on the horizon, was a mass of white-the foil into which the entire city had been set-that was beginning to turn gold with the rising sun. The pale gold agitated in ascending waves of heat and refraction until it seemed to be a place of a thousand cities, or the border of heaven. The horse stopped to stare, his eyes filled with golden light. Steam issued from his nostrils as he stood in contemplation of the impossible and alluring distance. He stayed in the street as if he were a statue, while the gold strengthened and boiled before him in a bed of blue. It seemed to be a perfect place, and he determined to go there. He started forward but soon found that the street was blocked by a massy iron gate that closed off the Battery. He doubled back and went another way, only to find another gate of exactly the same design. Trying many streets, he came to many heavy gates, none of which was open. While he was stuck in this labyrinth, the gold grew in intensity and seemed to cover half the world. The empty white field was surely a way to that other, perfect world, and, though he had no idea of how he would cross the water, the horse wanted the Battery as if he had been born for it. He galloped desperately along the approachways, through the alleys, and over the snow-covered greens, always with an eye to the deepening gold. At the end of what seemed to be the last street leading to the open, he found yet another gate, locked with a simple latch. He was breathing hard, and the condensed breath rose around his face as he stared through the bars. That was it: he would never step onto the Battery, there somehow to launch himself over the blue and green ribbons of water, toward the golden clouds. He was just about to turn and retrace his steps through the city, perhaps to find the bridge again and the way back to Brooklyn, when, in the silence that made his own breathing seem like the breaking of distant surf, he heard a great many footsteps. At first they were faint, but they continued until they began to pound harder and harder and he could feel a slight trembling in the ground, as if another horse were going by. But this was no horse, these were men, who suddenly exploded into view. Through the black iron gate, he saw them running across the Battery. They took long high steps, because the wind had drifted the snow almost up to their knees. Though they ran with all their strength, they ran in slow motion. It took them a long time to get to the center of the field, and when they did the horse could see that one man was in front and that the others, perhaps a dozen, chased him. The man being chased breathed heavily, and would sometimes drive ahead in deliberate bursts of speed. Sometimes he fell and bolted right back up, casting himself forward. They, too, fell at times, and got up more slowly. Soon this spread them out in a ragged line. They waved their arms and shouted. He, on the other hand, was perfectly silent, and he seemed almost stiff in his running, except when he leapt snowbanks or low rails and spread his arms like wings. As the man got closer, the horse took a liking to him. He moved well, though not like a horse or a dancer or someone who always hears music, but with spirit. What was happening appeared to be, solely because of the way that this man moved, more profound than a simple chase across the snow. Nonetheless, they gained on him. It was difficult to understand how, since they were dressed in heavy coats and bowler hats, and he was hatless in a scarf and winter jacket. He had winter boots, and they had low street shoes which had undoubtedly filled with numbing snow. But they were just as fast or faster than he was, they were good at it, and they seemed to have had much practice.Copyright © 1983 by Mark HelprinAll rights reserved.
